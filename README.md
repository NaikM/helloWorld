# helloWorld
A test repository to try out git functions. 

The following paragraph is to test out making commits and later merging them into the master.
My name is Monisha. Here are some of the things I like:
Morning walks with chill music
Ocean side apartments
Nessie (yes I want to visit Loch Ness)
Infographics because they make sense
Suffering through a hard to read book and appreciating it
Holes in arguments 
Aardvarks
